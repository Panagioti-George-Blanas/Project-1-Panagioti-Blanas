        <h1>Okay buckle down this is going to take a while</h1>
    
        <p>I have had an intense interest in the video game series Shin Megami Tensei since my freshman year of high school. 
        It began with playing the spin off series Persona (specifically Persona 3 Portable for the PSP) and then branching off into 
        the main series and the other Persona spin off games.</p>
    
        <h2>Boy Peter that sure sounds nifty but what is Shin Megami Tensei?</h2>
    
        <p>To give a very brief description, Shin Megami Tensei is a Japanese media franchise, primarily consisting of video games but also 
        consisting of books, movies, tv shows, and weird somewhat uncomfortable stage plays where adults attempt to imitate fictional high schoolers 
        with super powers.</p> 
        
    
        <p>The series is developed by the company Atlus and owned by Sega (you know the guys who made that funky blue hedgehog that runs fast) 
        and actually began as a series of science fiction novels known as “Digital Devil Story” written by Aya Nishitani released on March 31st, 1986. 
        The first actual game in the franchise as we know it today was released a year later in 1987 under the name “Digital Devil Story: Megami Tensei” for the Famicom. 
        Depicted below is the mascot of the series Jack Frost the snowman whos catchphrase is "Hee Ho!"</p>
        
        <img src="media/jackfrost.jpg" alt="Hee Ho!">

        <p>The series is about a set of young individuals achieving the ability to summon in some way or another beings known as demons or in 
        the case of the spinoff series Personas. The main cast then use these abilities to save the world in some way or another, or end it in 
        some of the games, its your choice as the player what you want to do as the series usually provides you with themes of law, chaos, and 
        neutrality and asks you to choose a side providing you with different endings and gameplay for each. Additionally the main line series 
        has been massively overshadowed by its spin off series known as Persona which has gained some big success thanks to the inclusion of the
        main character Joker from Persona 5 being a playable character in Nintendos Super Smash Brothers Ultimate.</p>
        
    
        <p>The demons/personas are the most interesting part of the entire series as they are meant to be beings born from human consciousness 
        and thoughts, thus many of them are characters  directly taken from real world mythology, religion, fairy tales, literature, and in 
        some cases real people who actually existed in history. The player then recruits these beings through negotiations to have them join 
        their side in battle as this game follows a turn based battle system where each member of your party takes a turn to hit the opponent(s)
        and then the opponent(s) takes a turn to hit you.</p>
        
    
        <p>You would think using real world religious figures as disposable party members to fight and quite literally referring to those 
        figures as “demons” would be a very controversial topic and get the series into hot water especially here in the USA but nothing 
        has really come about, most likely because the series as a whole is pretty niche here as opposed to Japan.</p>
        
    
        <p>So yeah that’s the synopsis, obviously I’m making big strides in information here but that’s the best I could summarize the series, 
        a niche turn based RPG where you summon monsters to fight. Kinda like Pokemon but cooler…at least in my opinion it’s cooler.</p>
        
    
        <p>Also this series has a grand total of ninety six games under its belt including spin offs so yeah there’s a lot to chew on here so 
        jump in wherever you’d like.</p>
        

        <p>Here are some very brief reviews of my thoughts on some of the more popular games in the series. If you intend to play these game 
        for yourself then I recommend not reading these due to spoilers and I am writing these assuming whoever is reading already has knowledge of the games. </p>
    
        <p>I have also included my favorite songs from each individual game so feel free to give those a listen if you'd like! :)</p>
    
    
        <h2>Shin Megami Tensei: Persona 3:</h2>
    
        <p>Great story, great themes about the inevitability of death, the use of blues to convey the sadness that dominates the entire 
        story from beginning to end is great. I’d actually say the blue used throughout the game portrays a message of sadness at 
        the beginning but towards the end it is also meant to symbolize the peace that comes in death, this is further underscored by 
        the final scene of the game where Aigis (one of your party members) comforts the main character as he passes away from sacrificing
        himself to save the word. The scene is quiet, the music is calm, it isn’t some grand departure from the world, it’s a silent 
        goodbye between friends. </p>
    
        <p>Did I cry? 
    
        <p>Of course I cried, what about it?</p>
    
        <p>Apart from the story the actual gameplay is…fine. It’s just alright, I’m not a fan of the fatigue 
        system that kind of drags the early game, granted this system basically disappears in the later levels but 
        I’m the kind of person who likes to burn through one floor of Tartartus in a night so I can focus on social 
        links the next few in game days so as you can imagine having the game literally tell me to stop after four or 
        five battles is pretty annoying, JUST LET ME PLAY HOW I WANT I DON’T CARE IF AKIHIKO IS TIRED WE NEED TO FINISH THIS FLOOR.</p>
    
        <p>I have a lot to say about the remake as well but I’m trying to keep this brief so lets just say the remake was a massive 
        improvement visually but in terms of some gameplay changes they missed the mark, and in terms of cutscenes I think the original 
        runs circles around the remake, no contest.</p>
    
        <p>But yeah this game is great.</p>

        <h2>Shin Megami Tensei: Persona 4:</h2>
    
        <p>This is the best game in the series I don’t care what anyone else says Persona 4 stays winning.</p>
    
        <p>This game has fun gameplay, great characters, and the music has sent me into another plane of existence at three in the morning
        multiple times. The setting of a small quiet Japanese town mixed with the intensity of a murder mystery investigation is 
        just such a fun and engaging time (for me, not the characters that got murdered). </p>
    
        <p>Honestly there is nothing about this game I particularly disliked apart from the dungeon design which at some points 
        felt a bit lazy but even so it wasn’t so egregious that I disliked playing through them.</p>
    
        <p>I think the enhanced rerelease Persona 4 Golden added such great additional content, playing the game in the winter 
        season when the song “Snowflakes” is playing makes me swell with emotion and nostalgia for being with friends in High School, 
        before the stresses of life and college and work made us drift apart slowly both mentally and physically as people moved away.</p> 
    
        <p>I guess that’s why this game has stuck with me so long, it feels like coming home.</p>

        <h2>Shin Megami Tensei: Persona 5:</h2>

        <p>Persona 5, ahhh yes the most popular game in the entire franchise. </p>
    
        <p>Yeah this game is good, I think in terms of style and flair it easily blows its predecessors out of the water. 
        The mix of red and blacks truly give off this feeling of rebellion and the theme of changing the future that are present 
        in the game from the opening minutes all the way to the final goodbye scene. </p>
    
        <p>I think in terms of gameplay it’s fun but it always felt like something was missing. I wish there were more stealth elements, 
        it felt like the stealth elements that were present didn’t require actually thinking about the best ways to clear a room without 
        being seen you could basically just brute force your way through without thinking about it. And yes I understand at its core this 
        game is an RPG, making an RPG where you could avoid all fights would create a balancing issue but gosh darn it my favorite portions 
        of the game were the palace infiltrations specifically BECAUSE it felt sneaky, I want more of that please and I’d honestly sacrifice the balance of the game if it meant I could do more of that.</p>
    
        <p>The story is good, Maruki is a compelling antagonist with a genuinely sad backstory and the best part is that he is a 
        villain that ACTUALLY can be sympathized with. The guy just really loved his wife and wanted the best for people. That being said,
        the way he went about “helping” people is morally questionable at best and a blatant human rights violation worst but that’s a 
        description suited for a much longer discussion.</p>

        <h2>Shin Megami Tensei 4</h2>
    
        <p>So here we cover a game in the actual main line series.</p>
    
        <p>SMT 4 is a very interesting romp through a modern Tokyo after an apocalyptic event flooded the city with demons. 
        A group of samurai then head off to find the source of the demons and, through the choices of the players, destroy the source 
        and restore law and order, embrace the source causing more chaos, or find a middle ground of both.</p>
    
        <p>This game was great, fast snappy combat, an interesting story, characters that actually grow and progress throughout the 
        journey and not to mention the music is pretty solid.</p>

        <p>I will say I see a lot of people complain about the smirk system in this game, a mechanic where if you hit an enemies weak 
        point or if an enemy hits your weak point there is a chance you/the enemy get an extra turn, and they say it is unbalanced but I 
        personally never had an issue with it and I thought it was a welcomed change to shake up the gameplay.</p>

        <h2>Shin Megami Tensei 3: Nocturne</h2>
    
        <p>This will be the last one I cover so I'll keep this one brief.</p>
    
        <p>SMT Nocturne is hard and I love it. It's super weird, the concepts presented are extremely interesing, and the demi-fiend 
        is an awesome name for an awesome character design.</p>
    
        <p>10/10 and if it wasn't for Persona 3 this would be the best SMT title on the Playstation 2.</p>
