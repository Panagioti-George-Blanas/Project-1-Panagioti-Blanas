    <h1>Okay buckle down this is going to take a while</h1>

    <p>I have had an intense interest in the video game series Shin Megami Tensei since my freshman year of high school. It began with playing the spin off series Persona (specifically Persona 3 Portable for the PSP) and then branching off into the main series and the other Persona spin off games.</p>

    <h2>Boy Peter that sure sounds nifty but what is Shin Megami Tensei?</h2>

    <p>To give a very brief description, Shin Megami Tensei is a Japanese media franchise, primarily consisting of video games but also consisting of books, movies, tv shows, and weird somewhat uncomfortable stage plays where adults attempt to imitate fictional high schoolers with super powers. 

    The series is developed by the company Atlus and owned by Sega (you know the guys who made that funky blue hedgehog that runs fast) and actually began as a series of science fiction novels known as “Digital Devil Story” written by Aya Nishitani released on March 31st, 1986. The first actual game in the franchise as we know it today was released a year later in 1987 under the name “Digital Devil Story: Megami Tensei” for the Famicom. 

    The series is about a set of young individuals achieving the ability to summon in some way or another beings known as demons or in the case of the spinoff series Personas. The main cast then use these abilities to save the world in some way or another, or end it in some of the games, its your choice as the player what you want to do as the series usually provides you with themes of law, chaos, and neutrality and asks you to choose a side providing you with different endings and gameplay for each. Additionally the main line series has been massively overshadowed by its spin off series known as Persona which has gained some big success thanks to the inclusion of the main character Joker from Persona 5 being a playable character in Nintendos Super Smash Brothers Ultimate.

    The demons/personas are the most interesting part of the entire series as they are meant to be beings born from human consciousness and thoughts, thus many of them are characters  directly taken from real world mythology, religion, fairy tales, literature, and in some cases real people who actually existed in history. The player then recruits these beings through negotiations to have them join their side in battle as this game follows a turn based battle system where each member of your party takes a turn to hit the opponent(s) and then the opponent(s) takes a turn to hit you.

    You would think using real world religious figures as disposable party members to fight and quite literally referring to those figures as “demons” would be a very controversial topic and get the series into hot water especially here in the USA but nothing has really come about, most likely because the series as a whole is pretty niche here as opposed to Japan.

    So yeah that’s the synopsis, obviously I’m making big strides in information here but that’s the best I could summarize the series, a niche turn based RPG where you summon monsters to fight. Kinda like Pokemon but cooler…at least in my opinion it’s cooler.

    Also this series has a grand total of ninety six games under its belt including spin offs so yeah there’s a lot to chew on here so jump in wherever you’d like.

    Here are some very brief reviews of my thoughts on some of the more popular games in the series. If you intend to play these game for yourself then I recommend not reading these due to spoilers and I am writing these assuming whoever is reading already has knowledge of the games. </p>
