    <h1>Hello! :)</h1>

    <p>My name is Panagioti Blanas but everyone just calls me Peter, and this website showcases an about me page (which you are currently reading), my professional resume, and an overly long rant about my favorite video game franchise. Feel free to explore and learn more about me and don't worry I get it if you don't want to read everything I wrote about the video game.</p>

    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>I am an aspiring IT professional currently pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Information Technology Management at Illinois Institute of Technology. I have a strong foundation in programming, database management, and computer networking.</p>
    
    <h2>Heres a cool seal picture</h2>

    <p>When I was younger I actually really wanted to be a marine biologist, obviously I went down a wildly different path later on but I still have a huge appreciation for sea life because it's just so strange and goofy.</p>
